## Research Limitations

- Alma restricts public access to detailed interface screenshots
- Most visual content requires personalized demo
- No comprehensive video walkthroughs publicly available
- Limited user-generated visual content online

## Recommendation

Given the limited public visual content available, the most effective approach would be to:
1. Schedule an official Alma demo and request recording permission
2. Download their mobile app (if available) for direct interface review
3. Check software review sites for user-uploaded screenshots
4. Focus competitive analysis on feature comparison rather than visual comparison

This research confirms that Alma prioritizes controlled demos over public interface exposure, which is common for B2B SIS platforms.
