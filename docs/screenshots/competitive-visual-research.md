   - Demo-gated access to visual content
   - Suggests lack of confidence in UI/UX design

2. **Legacy Design Approach**: 
   - Web-first with mobile adaptation
   - Dashboard/widget-based interfaces
   - Multiple login systems for different roles
   - Complex navigation requiring "numerous clicks"

3. **Feature-Heavy Interfaces**:
   - Emphasis on comprehensive functionality over usability
   - Complex configuration and customization requirements
   - Administrative overhead for setup and maintenance

### User Experience Complaints

**Consistent Pain Points Across Competitors:**
- Outdated visual design
- Complex navigation
- Multiple clicks for simple tasks

**Marketing Opportunity**: 
- "See exactly what you're getting" transparency
- Side-by-side interface comparisons
- "No training required" guarantee
- Public demo that doesn't require sales calls

## Recommended Visual Strategy

## Next Steps for Visual Development

### Immediate Actions
1. Create high-fidelity mockups for key interfaces
2. Develop interactive prototypes for user testing
3. Document design system and components
4. Plan comprehensive screenshot strategy

### Long-term Visual Strategy
1. Build design-first marketing approach
2. Develop visual content that demonstrates superiority
3. Create public-facing design documentation
4. Establish design leadership in SIS market

## Conclusion

The competitive research reveals a significant opportunity in the SIS market. All major competitors hide their interfaces, suggesting poor confidence in their design quality. User feedback consistently mentions outdated visuals, complex navigation, and poor user experience.

This presents a clear market opportunity to compete on design and user experience - areas where current solutions are demonstrably weak. A mobile-first, visually appealing, and simple-to-use SIS could significantly differentiate in this market.

**Key Insight**: The fact that no competitor shows their interface publicly suggests they know their designs are weak. This creates a massive opportunity for a design-first approach.
