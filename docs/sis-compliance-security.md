# Student Information System Compliance & Security Guide

## Overview

This document outlines the compliance requirements and security measures necessary for a Student Information System handling sensitive educational and personal data. Compliance is not optional - violations can result in significant fines and loss of trust.

## Regulatory Compliance

### FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act)

**Applicability**: All schools receiving federal funding (US)

**Key Requirements**:

1. **Parent Rights**
   - Access to their child's educational records within 45 days
   - Right to request corrections to inaccurate records
   - Control over disclosure of personally identifiable information
   - Annual notification of rights

2. **Eligible Student Rights** (18+ or attending post-secondary)
   - Rights transfer from parents to students
   - Students control their own records

3. **Directory Information**
   - Schools may disclose without consent if properly noticed:
     - Name, address, telephone
     - Date and place of birth
     - Dates of attendance
     - Grade level
   - Parents can opt-out of directory information sharing

4. **Permitted Disclosures Without Consent**
   - School officials with legitimate educational interest

  logAccess(userId: string, recordId: string, action: string): void;
  
  // Enforce 45-day response requirement
  trackAccessRequest(requestId: string, dueDate: Date): void;
  
  // Parent/student consent management
  recordConsent(
    studentId: string,
    disclosureType: string,
    consentGiven: boolean
  ): void;
  
  // Directory information opt-out
  setDirectoryOptOut(studentId: string, optOut: boolean): void;
}
```

### COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act)

**Applicability**: Online services collecting data from children under 13

**Key Requirements**:

1. **Parental Consent**

## Security Requirements

### Authentication Security

**Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
```typescript
interface MFARequirements {
  // Required for admin accounts
  adminMFARequired: true;
  
  // Available methods
  methods: ['sms', 'email', 'authenticator', 'biometric'];
  
  // Grace period for adoption
  enforcementDate: Date;
  
  // Backup codes required
  backupCodes: number; // minimum 10
}
```

**Password Requirements**
```typescript
const passwordPolicy = {
  minLength: 12,
  requireUppercase: true,
  requireLowercase: true,
  requireNumbers: true,
  requireSpecialChars: true,
  preventReuse: 12, // last 12 passwords
  maxAge: 90, // days
  preventCommon: true, // check against common passwords
  preventPersonalInfo: true // no names, birthdays, etc.
};
```

### Data Encryption

**Encryption Standards**
```yaml
In Transit:
  - TLS 1.3 minimum
  - HSTS enabled
  - Certificate pinning for mobile apps
  - No weak ciphers

At Rest:
  - AES-256-GCM for database
  - Encrypted file storage
  - Encrypted backups
  - Key rotation every 90 days

Field Level:
  - SSN: Always encrypted
  - Medical records: Always encrypted
  - Financial data: Always encrypted
  - PII: Encrypted based on classification
```

**Key Management**
```typescript
interface KeyManagement {
  // Use HSM or KMS
  keyStorage: 'AWS_KMS' | 'Azure_KeyVault' | 'HashiCorp_Vault';
  
  // Separate keys per data type
  keys: {
    database: string;
    files: string;
    pii: string;
    medical: string;
  };
  
  // Automated rotation
  rotationSchedule: {
    frequency: 90; // days
    automated: true;
  };
}
```

### Access Control

**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
```typescript
enum Permission {
  // Student permissions
  STUDENT_VIEW_OWN = 'student:view:own',
  STUDENT_EDIT_OWN = 'student:edit:own',
  
  // Class permissions  
  CLASS_VIEW_ENROLLED = 'class:view:enrolled',
  CLASS_VIEW_ALL = 'class:view:all',
  
  // Grade permissions
  GRADE_VIEW_OWN = 'grade:view:own',
  GRADE_VIEW_CLASS = 'grade:view:class',
  GRADE_EDIT_CLASS = 'grade:edit:class',
  
  // Admin permissions
  ADMIN_FULL = 'admin:*',
  ADMIN_REPORTS = 'admin:reports',
  ADMIN_USERS = 'admin:users'
}

interface Role {
  name: string;
  permissions: Permission[];
  dataScope: 'own' | 'class' | 'school' | 'all';
}
```

**Principle of Least Privilege**
- Default deny all
- Grant only necessary permissions
- Regular permission audits
- Time-based access for temporary needs

### Audit Logging

**Required Audit Events**
```typescript
interface AuditLog {
  // Who
  userId: string;
  userRole: string;
  ipAddress: string;
  userAgent: string;
  
  // What
  action: 'create' | 'read' | 'update' | 'delete' | 'login' | 'export';
  resource: string;
  resourceId: string;
  
  // When
  timestamp: Date;
  
  // Where
  location?: GeoLocation;
  
  // Why
  reason?: string; // For sensitive access
  
  // Changes
  previousValue?: any;
  newValue?: any;
}
```

**Audit Requirements**
- Immutable logs (write-once)
- 7-year retention
- Encrypted storage
- Regular reviews
- Anomaly detection
- Export capabilities

### Data Classification

**Classification Levels**
```typescript
enum DataClassification {
  PUBLIC = 1,        // School name, address
  INTERNAL = 2,      // Staff directories
  CONFIDENTIAL = 3,  // Student grades
  RESTRICTED = 4     // SSN, medical records
}

interface DataHandling {
  classification: DataClassification;
  encryptionRequired: boolean;
  accessLogging: boolean;
  retentionPeriod: number; // days
  deletionMethod: 'soft' | 'hard' | 'crypto-shred';
}
```

## Security Implementation

  return await db.query(
    'SELECT * FROM students WHERE id = $1',
    [id]
  );
};

// Input validation
const validateStudentId = (id: string): boolean => {
  return /^[0-9a-f]{8}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{12}$/i.test(id);
};
```
